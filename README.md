# word2vec_neural_net
Word2vector neural network that uses skip-gram model to create word vectors from binary one hot encoded vectors

You can go to https://github.com/bnicholl/one_hots_with_window to ust the algorithm that I wrote that encodes the one hot vectors and their respective labels that can be used for this neurat net. Also read the readme documentation to see how the one hot vectors and their respective labels work.
